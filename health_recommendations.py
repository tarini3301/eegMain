Health Recommendations Engine
==============================
Generates personalized health recommendations based on:
1. Brain age gap (predicted - chronological age)
2. SHAP feature contributions (which EEG frequency bands show accelerated aging)

Recommendations are evidence-based and sourced from neurophysiology literature.
